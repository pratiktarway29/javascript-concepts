In JavaScript, both `undefined` and `null` are special values that represent the absence of a meaningful value, but they are used in slightly different contexts and have subtle differences:

1. **`undefined`**:

   - `undefined` is a primitive value in JavaScript.
   - It typically represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value or a function that does not return a value explicitly.
   - When you declare a variable without assigning a value to it, or when you access a property or element that doesn't exist in an object or array, JavaScript returns `undefined`.
   - It is the initial value of function parameters if no argument is provided.
   - You can also explicitly assign a variable the value `undefined`.

   ```javascript
   let x;
   console.log(x); // undefined

   function foo(y) {
     console.log(y); // undefined if no argument is provided
   }

   let obj = {};
   console.log(obj.property); // undefined
   ```

2. **`null`**:

   - `null` is also a primitive value in JavaScript.
   - It is often used to represent an intentional absence of any object value or as a placeholder for an object that is expected to be there but isn't.
   - It is explicitly assigned to indicate that a variable should have no value or that an object property should be empty.
   - `null` is typically used when you want to explicitly state that a variable or object property has no value, whereas `undefined` often represents an unintentional absence of a value.

   ```javascript
   let y = null;
   console.log(y); // null

   let obj = {
     property: null,
   };
   console.log(obj.property); // null
   ```

In summary, `undefined` usually represents the absence of a value that should exist but doesn't, often due to variables not being initialized or properties not being defined, while `null` represents the intentional absence of a value or an empty object property. Understanding the difference between them is essential for writing clean and predictable JavaScript code.
