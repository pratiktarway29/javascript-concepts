In JavaScript, `==` and `===` are two different comparison operators used to compare values or variables, but they behave differently due to their level of strictness.

1. `==` (Equality Operator):
   - The `==` operator checks for equality of values but does not consider the data type.
   - It performs type coercion, which means it tries to convert the operands to the same data type before making the comparison.
   - If the values are of different data types, JavaScript will attempt to convert one or both of them to a common type and then compare them.
   - For example:

     ```javascript
     5 == "5" // true, because "5" is converted to a number before comparison
     true == 1  // true, because true is converted to 1
     null == undefined // true
     ```

2. `===` (Strict Equality Operator):
   - The `===` operator checks for equality of values and also checks that the data types of the operands are the same.
   - It does not perform type coercion, so if the data types are different, it returns `false`.
   - This operator is often recommended because it avoids unexpected type coercion issues and is more explicit about your intentions.
   - For example:

     ```javascript
     5 === "5" // false, because the data types are different
     true === 1 // false, because the data types are different
     null === undefined // false, because the data types are different
     ```

In summary, `==` is used for loose equality comparisons, which may involve type coercion, while `===` is used for strict equality comparisons, which require both the values and data types to be the same. It's generally a good practice to use `===` for most comparisons to avoid unexpected behavior caused by type coercion.
